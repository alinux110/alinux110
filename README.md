## 📈 How I approach projects
- Start with a **small, testable core** (the smallest thing that can possibly work).  
- Add **observability** (metrics, logs, traces) before adding “cool features”.  
- Automate deployments and backups so humans only do interesting work.  
- Write small, well-documented tools that I can reuse across teams.

---

## 🧩 Collaboration & Contributions
I welcome:
- Improving documentation & developer experience.
- DevOps / SRE automation and observability projects.
- Small Python/Django utilities and infra templates.
